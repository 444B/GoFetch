GoFetch: Breaking Constant-Time Cryptographic Implementations Using Data Memory-Dependent Prefetchers -- [USENIX Security'24](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24)  

## Overview
GoFetch is a microarchitectural side-channel attack that can extract secret keys from constant-time cryptographic implementations via data memory-dependent prefetchers (DMPs).  

We show that DMPs are present in many Apple CPUs and pose a real threat to multiple cryptographic implementations, allowing us to extract keys from OpenSSL Diffie-Hellman, Go RSA, as well as CRYSTALS Kyber and Dilithium.
